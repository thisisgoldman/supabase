## Prerequisites

To set up replication, the following is recommended:

- Instance size of XL or greater
- [IPv4 add-on](/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address) enabled

To create a replication slot, you will need to use the `postgres` user and follow the instructions in our [guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/setup-replication-external).

<Admonition type="note">
  If you are running Postgres 17 or higher, you can create a new user and grant them replication
  permissions with the `postgres` user. For versions below 17, you will need to use the `postgres`
  user.
</Admonition>

If you are replicating to an external system and using any of the tools below, check their documentation first and we have added additional information where the setup with Supabase can vary.

<TabPanel id="airbyte" label="Airbyte">

Airbyte has the following [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/postgres/) for setting up Postgres as a source, either in their cloud offering or by self-hosting.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:

1. Use the `postgres` user
2. Select `logical replication` as the replication method (`xmin` is possible, but not recommended)

## Troubleshooting

Airbyte has a known [issue](https://discuss.airbyte.io/t/postgres-source-replication-slot-safe-wal-size-only-reset-when-a-change-occurs/3263/7) where it does not clear WAL files on each successful sync. The recommended workaround is to have a `heartbeat` table that you write changes to once an hour.>

<TabPanel id="fivetran" label="Fivetran">

Fivetran has the following [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide) for setting up Postgres as a source.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:

1. In Step 2, choose `logical replication` as the sync mechanism
2. In Step 3, do not create a user and use the existing `postgres` user for replication
3. In Step 5, no need to modify any WAL settings as we have done that for you

<TabPanel id="sequin" label="Sequin">

[Sequin](https://sequinstream.com/) streams changes from your Supabase database to destinations like SQS, HTTP webhooks, Elastic, and Redis. Sequin guarantees delivery of every change, in a strict order, with real-time speed. It natively integrates with Supabase and supports the default IPv6 networking. It's built to power use cases like audit logging, replicating with a cache, maintaining a search index, or powering a microservices architecture.

Sequin has a [Supabase setup guide](https://sequinstream.com/docs/how-to/setup-supabase) to walk you through the steps of connecting your Supabase database to Sequin. Here are the steps:

1. Copy the connection string for your Supabase database.
2. In the Sequin console, click to create a new database and paste in your connection string.
3. Follow the instructions to add a publication and replication slot to your database.
4. Create your sink and watch the date flow.

Feel free to join the Sequin [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BV8wFXvNtY) or [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/sequin-community/shared_invite/zt-37begzach-4aUwR5xt_XgivdvctZDemA) if you have additional questions.
